    🙋 FAQ 🙋
  </summary>
  
  __Can I run Sanguine with other datapacks?__<br/>
  It depends, but if the datapack is on Smithed, then it likely can. You may have to merge the resource pack and/or datapack with Weld.<br/>
  ➼ [weld](https://weld.smithed.dev)<br/>
  
  __I am experiencing various rendering issues__<br/>
  OptiFine tends to cause issues with our datapacks. These may include flipped or invisible monsters, a sanity bar offset and more. We're not exactly sure why, as OptiFine is closed source. There's many better alternatives here. Also note that even Iris shaders don't work.<br/>
  ➼ [on optifine](https://tinyurl.com/optifine-is-mid)<br/>

  __This feature is broken__<br/>
  Some server or plugin software may cause issues with our datapacks. This notoriously includes Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Paper and Purpur. You can try to mess around with the config files, but it's recommended to use Vanilla or Fabric, and sometimes Forge with varying results.<br/><br/>

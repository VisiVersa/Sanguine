|=================|
| PERMITTED USAGE |
|=================|
We are really lenient with our projects, and we trust you to do the right thing. This means that you are entitled to:
- use and enjoy our content freely.
- host our content on multiplayer servers.
- view and use excerpts of our code, so long as credit is provided.
- modify our code for personal use.
- include our projects in any personal modpacks or on multiplayer servers with other content.
- take inspiration from our projects or even create similar projects, so long as the idea is transformative.

|==================|
| PROHIBITED USAGE |
|==================|
Unless you are specifically given permission from us, please do not:
- republish, reupload or otherwise reuse our model and texture assets.
- republish, reupload or otherwise redistribute our projects.
     * you may reupload a resource pack on a hosting site for server usage.
     * you may redistribute a resource pack to server members.
     * should you make retextures or other asset changes, those are also permitted to reupload; however, said reuploads must not contain our assets.
- include our projects in any publicly uploaded modpack or "datapack-pack."
     * we do make exceptions for this, but you must consult with us first.
- directly profit off of our projects in any way.
- use our projects as a part of promotion for any paid material.
- create indirect links to our projects; this means that links cannot redirect you multiple times in one click.
- directly copy ideas and themeing; of course, inspiration is okay, we take plenty ourselves, but it's fairly obvious when something is copied.
If you are in doubt of something, or simply want permission for usage, please ask us!

| CREDIT |
|========|
If any of the following apply:
- your project is directly inspired by seeing ours, taking core mechanics, themes or ideas,
- you are redistributing our projects or assets in any way,
- you are creating a resource pack that includes our work (i.e. asset changes),
- you have received permission from us to include our projects in a modpack or "datapack-pack,"
then you must give proper credit.

Proper credit includes:
- a link to the following GitHub page: https://github.com/VisiVersa
- a mention of the relevant project(s),
- optionally, what specifically has been used.

Hope you enjoy!
